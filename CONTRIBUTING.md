## Code of Conduct

This website and those participating in any of its spaces are governed by its
[code of conduct][conduct]. By participating you are also expected to uphold
this code. Report any unacceptable behavior to [last_talon@new.rr.com][contact].

## Reporting Bugs

  please provide any additional information there.

  the problem

## Submitting Changes

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Thank you!

- Open a [pull request] against the `main` branch
- Clearly describe the problem and solution
- Include any relevant [issue] number
- Be sure to check our [style guide]

### Did you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Great!

- Create an [issue] suggesting the feature.
  - We love when people contribute, but we hate for their effort to be wasted.
    Discussing the issue ahead of time can ensure the code you write will be
    accepted.
- Fork the project, check our [style guide], and start writing
- Consider opening a draft [pull request] against `main` right away. This is the
  best way to discuss the code as you write it.
- When you're done, be sure to open a [pull request]. Include the [issue] number
  for any associated issues.

### Did you fix something purely cosmetic in the codebase?

We appreciate your enthusiasm, however cosmetic code patches are unlikely to be
approved. We do care about code quality (please check our [style guide]), but
the cost of reviewing changes that don't add any substantial stability,
functionality, or testability outweighs the benefit of the change.

## Style Guide

If you're contributing, please follow our style guide. It maintains the quality
of our code and helps us work together.

We use [Prettier] and [ESLint] to keep our style in check. These are included as
dev dependencies with the project. They're already configured for use, simply
run them or set up your editor to run them automatically.
